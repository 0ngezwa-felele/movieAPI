My app currently is able to register a new user, login with username and password with the existing users, search for movies and add favourite movies for the looged user 

What's not working currently is the ability to go to user's playlist, the added movies only show on the database and that's something i'm still working on, and i also need to reshape the displayed list of movies together with their images 
 
 The issues that i'm currently experiencing are of deployment, on my local it's working as i have describe previously but after github deployment only registration and movie searching works. With heroku it's refusing to push and
